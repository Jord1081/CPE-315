Lab 3: Build a MIPS simulator front-end assembler/parser

Authors: Aaron, Matt, and Jordan

The goal of this lab was to build a two-pass MIPS assembler in C that would be
used in later labs. We were required to properly handle:

1. Comments and operands
2. Labels
3. Mnemonics
   a. The instructions and, andi, or, ori, add, addu, addiu, sll, srl, sra, 
      sltu, sub, sltiu, beq, bne, lw, sw, lui, j, jr, and jal.
   b. The ability to define memory-resident constant values using .word and
      .byte assembler directives
4. Operands
5. Two Passes
