Lab 1: Floating Point Numbers 

Authors: Aaron, Matt, and Jordan

This lab was designed to to gain an understanding of how floating point
numbers are represented, and to understand how a floating point operation is
carried out. In this lab we implemented several functions to achieve this
goal.

1. Unpack IEEE 754 argument 
2. Single precision floating point add
3. Single precision floating point subtract
4. Double precision floating point multiply
5. Pack IEEE 754 Result
